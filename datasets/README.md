# Datasets
Because of the lack of space in Git Storage for Large Files (LFS), I have to delete the large `.csv` files from the repository. I will leave the filtered `.csv` datasets with Taiwan data only, as well as `GlobalTemperatures.csv` files.

Please note for reference the source for temperature data is the [Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) dataset, available in Kaggle. You can always retrieve it and work locally with this data if you want to make some other experiments and require other countries data, you will not be able to push the experiment results and so on however not the large dataset files to GitHub.

For the corrected Taiwan city coordinates I made use of [World Cities dataset](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities), and for the taiwanese cities that did not appear in this dataset, I used Google Maps to retrieve the geographical coordinates.
